                During my last internship, I was involved in many projects, but one required the use of my teamwork skills the most. It was a strenuous research project with a tight deadline and highly ambitious ideas. It was about using motion tracking technology to develop and implement live performances augmented with computer graphics.

                I volunteered for the responsibility of handling the motion tracking system. This was a core part of the project. Working with the visual effect artists, dancers, and the stage crew, I learned to adapt to the needs of the team and improve upon each otherâ€™s ideas. Discussing possible art tech ideas in meetings for a month, we were given one week to prepare for a live demonstration for our clients.

                It was my first time in such a rushed and ambitious project. It was very demanding but working in a team like this made it very fulfilling. I propped up the 16 infrared cameras, linked them to a central switch, and through adapted software, I linked the data through a common communication protocol with my colleagues. Being the most familiar with the tracking data, I worked with the visual effect artists and dancers to plan our performances to make full use of the tracking technology.

                There was one problem, the visual effect artists had one additional performance that required a faster tracking system. Knowing my strengths in coding and maths, I proposed to develop our own tracking solution to solve this problem. The camera SDK was in C++, so I had to learn the language from scratch. I had to develop the vector theory, calibration maths, and systems on the fly, and I ended up developing a working prototype in three days.

            <p>
                I gave myself the responsibility of creating an improved tracking system, one that my team depended on, and I would go to any lengths to complete it. I and my coworkers worked tirelessly after office hours to complete our project from 8 am to 11 pm every day for the week. We were of all different ages but we ate together, worked together and laughed together. We became a great team that supported each other beneficially.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the week, we were able to present our seven different performances to our client. This experience taught me how rewarding it can be to work in a team. My competence in accomplishing this task put me into managing a few more motion-tracking projects the following month. Where I used the systems I developed along with my team to deliver performances to many live audiences.
