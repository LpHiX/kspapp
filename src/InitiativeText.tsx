            Our school suddenly announced that we would be returning to in-person learning. As a leader in the rocket science club, I knew it was our last and only opportunity to have an exciting time with in-person activities. I took the initiative and immediately instigated a committee meeting to discuss possible activity ideas. We pooled our ideas and came up with three unique experiments. 
            <br /><br />
            With my goal being to encourage excitement and learning about rocket science for all the members within our club, I gained the support of the other committee members for three of my activity ideas: liquid fuel injector, 3D printed landing leg experiments, woosh bottle experiments. 
            <br /><br />
            Two months in, I decided that we needed a goal. We had learned a lot about different components of the rocket but it was time to build one. It was then that I proposed the goal of sending a rocket to the height of 10 meters to our committee. For the fear of breaking Hong Kong stringent firework laws, we settled on achieving this goal using water rockets. Originally, we designed a bike pump setup, but there were leakages and other problems that led to multiple failed launches. I began researching into possible solutions and found the idea of a vinegar-baking soda water rocket appealing.
            <br /><br />
            The mixture allowed us to have independent variables, which allowed our students to learn more about rocket science. So I proposed this idea in the club. Some members wanted to stick with bike pumped rockets while others were with me. I then proposed to split our club to compromise so we could work together on both solutions. 
            <br /><br />
            After talking with the school to scope our options, we started prototyping. I delegated small tasks to the members in my team. I would buy the bottles, another student would buy the baking soda and vinegar and we assembled the prototype in our next meet. The tank was a large coca cola bottle held up with a retort stand. On the test day, we successfully launched the rocket to a height of two meters. This wasnâ€™t much, but the bike pump team saw the potential in our setup. We then united and focused all our efforts onto the vinegar and baking powder water rockets.
            <br /><br />
            We spent two more weeks calculating the fuel ratios, testing different methods of fuel mixing and rocket release and had one successful launch that went above 10 meters.
